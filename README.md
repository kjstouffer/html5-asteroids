# Asteroids!

An implementation of asteriods using javascript and the html canvas element.

This project was started in 2011 as a way for me to investigate the new features of HTML5's canvas. Most of it was completed then, except for scoring, collision detection, and a 'game over' screen. However, now it is fully complete! (but could probably use some additional polish)

## Controls

UP: accelerate  
DOWN: Decelerate / Stop  
LEFT: turn left  
RIGHT: turn right  
SPACE: shoot
